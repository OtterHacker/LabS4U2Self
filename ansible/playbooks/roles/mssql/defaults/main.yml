# Tuning options

# When an instance of SQL Server runs on a computer that has more than one microprocessor or CPU, 
# it detects the best degree of parallelism, that is, the number of processors employed to run a single statement, 
# for each parallel plan execution. You can use the max degree of parallelism option to limit the number of processors 
# to use in parallel plan execution. 
#
# If the affinity mask option is not set to the default, it may restrict the number of processors available to 
# SQL Server on symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systems. 
#
# To enable the server to determine the maximum degree of parallelism, set this option to 0, the default value. 
#
# See: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/configure-the-max-degree-of-parallelism-server-configuration-option

# Minimum memory to allocate to SQL

#
# see: Optimizing Server Performance Using Memory Configuration Options
# https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177455(v=sql.105).aspx
#
# The min server memory server configuration option can be used to ensure that 
# SQL Server does not release memory below the configured minimum server memory 
# once that threshold is reached. This configuration option can be set to a specific value 
# based on the size and activity of your SQL Server. If you choose to set this value, 
# set it to some reasonable value to ensure that the operating system does not request too 
# much memory from SQL Server, which can affect SQL Server performance.
